App Name: Psychology Today  

Because Psychology Today doesn't have an app currently, I think implementing an app that is able to access the directory of psychologists on their desktop website would be an amazing feat, along with other small interactive features like mental health tests, a compilation of psychology articles, and showcase important categories of mental health within the app. 

This design focus fulfills 4 of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. User accessibility and friendliness is so important when using this app, as the desktop website is so cluttered with information that it makes it difficult to rank the importance of each section. Having an app will allow us to transition Psychology Today to a more modern platform, the phone!

Psychology Today's mobile app would be ideally targeted to virtually all individuals seeking to improve their life by psychology, specifically Millennials and Gen-Z individuals. I want to make this app similar to BuzzFeed, which engages individuals by doing quizzes and other interesting features that keep the user happy and stimulated. In addition, for individuals who are struggling with mental health, this app is catered towards helping them find help and learn more about the various conditions surrounding their problems. 

My goal is to interview any Gen-Z or Millennial individual that has any goal towards improving themselves and ask them to go to their favorite website and see what they like about the desktop version compared to the mobile version to see what information would be useful to include in the mobile app. I am strictly searching to find particular elements to include in the mobile app, as I think it is important to declutter all of the miscellaneous, extraneous information that can make the user experience much more uncomfortable. This evaluation will be comprehensive, as I will determine what the best way to present this information to individuals who will use the mobile app.

Overall, Megan gave me more insight on what features she likes on the websites when she uses her desktop, and when she had discussed what was her mental process going on when she wanted to find specific information, it really gave me insight as to what and why people did what they did. Connecting this back to my mobile app, I am going to use this field study to guide a better, more optimized method of searching, which is comprehensive and allows users to see all results regarding that search query. Also, interviewing can take a turn sometimes, so it's important that you are able to help guide the interviewee to eensure everything goes smoothly.
