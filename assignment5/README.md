App Name: Psychology Today  

Because Psychology Today doesn't have an app currently, I think implementing an app that is able to access the directory of psychologists on their desktop website would be an amazing feat, along with other small interactive features like mental health tests, a compilation of psychology articles, and showcase important categories of mental health within the app. 

This design focus fulfills 4 of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. User accessibility and friendliness is so important when using this app, as the desktop website is so cluttered with information that it makes it difficult to rank the importance of each section. Having an app will allow us to transition Psychology Today to a more modern platform, the phone!

Psychology Today's mobile app would be ideally targeted to virtually all individuals seeking to improve their life by psychology, specifically Millennials and Gen-Z individuals. I want to make this app similar to BuzzFeed, which engages individuals by doing quizzes and other interesting features that keep the user happy and stimulated. In addition, for individuals who are struggling with mental health, this app is catered towards helping them find help and learn more about the various conditions surrounding their problems. 

My goal is to interview any Gen-Z or Millennial individual that has any goal towards improving themselves and ask them to go around the desktop website of Psychology Today to see what they like about the desktop version to see what information would be useful to include in the mobile app. I am strictly searching to find particular elements to include in the mobile app, as I think it is important to declutter all of the miscellaneous, extraneous information that can make the user experience much more uncomfortable. This evaluation will be comprehensive, as I will determine what the best way to present this information to individuals who will use the mobile app.
