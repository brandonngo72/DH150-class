# Psychology Today 
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us

Psychology Today is a magazine dedicated to making psychology accessible to the general public. The magazine's website aims to showcase therapy and health care professional directories and psychologist-written articles about the self.  

For the most part, Psychology Today provides a fairly accessible user experience for individuals; it's visually appealing and provides users a very rudimentary clickbait overview. However, the overall website has so much information concentrated on one page that makes it difficult to really pay any mind to any one thing. There's too much copy, and the "Top Posts" header image really doesn't make sense when "Today's Essential Reads" and "Most Popular" are right below it. As a whole, Psychology Today provides a convoluted user experience that ironically makes the mind more busy.

### Heuristic Evaluation of Psychology Today

I will be evaluating each of Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics, qualitatively measuring major usability issues on a severity rating scale of 1-3 (1 being a minor usability issue while 3 being a major usability issue).

#### #1 – Visibility of System Status
Severity Rating: 1

The website showcases a large header photo at the forefront (see above image), entitled "Top Posts" associated with a couple of articles beneath it. However, when hovering over the copy, the user would not be able to know if they were actually clicking on an article or not (it simply blends in with the other copy).

An easy fix would be a simple change of color, or highlighting the text (like above) when you hover over it. This would give the user appropriate feedback in real time that distinguishes the articles' copy from one another.

For the most part, Psychology Today does an overall good job with this heuristic, especially in their "Find a therapist" search bar, which provides users a drop-down list of locations and zip codes that appear as they type.

#### #2 – Match between system and the real world
Severity Rating: 1

![Heuristic2](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%232.png)

The language seen above in the "Basics" section of the website is intended to showcase a list of subcategories that users can access. Even taking into account that most of the categories are psychology-related terminology, some of these subcategories are far too complicated to understand for the general person. Acronyms like 'HEXACO' and words like 'Hebaphilia' aren't necessarily common knowledge.

Still, the urgency of this problem isn't too problematic, which is why I evaluated this heuristic with a severity rating of 1. The methodology of categorization is horrible and will further be discussed in heuristic #7.

#### #3 – User control and freedom
Severity Rating: 2

Psychology Today offers a pretty good job at ensuring that the user has control and freedom over exiting but fails to give users an easy undo action when it comes to clicking buttons and links. The majority of the buttons transfers the user to a different page rather than loading similar articles, which can be somewhat frustrating especially if the user is just browsing. In the example below, the "Look Inside" button takes the user to a completely different page, but this can be made more efficient by the utilization of a pop-up box of the magazine.

#### #4 – Consistency and standards
Severity Rating: 2

The website is fairly consistent in their usage of conventions, with the exception of their usage of buttons. For the entire website, all of the buttons are colored orange, while the buttons on the majority of their pages are grey.

![Heuristic4_V2](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%234_V2.png)

In addition, their "See More" buttons are not consistent amongst all the different sections. The "See More News" section does not have a button while the "See More Experts" does. 

![Heuristic4_V3](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%234_V3.png)
![Heuristic4_V4](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%234_V4.png)

Although the first example may be a stylistic decision, the latter is not consistent with the other buttons, which is why I deemed this heuristic with a severity rating of 2. 

#### #5 – Error prevention
Severity Rating: 2

Psychology Today's website does a good job in ensuring that during the user registration process for professionals, they make sure that the password is strong as you type the password. 

![Heuristic5](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%235.png)
![Heuristic5_V2](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%235_V2.png)

Still, error prevention can be made better in the login process when the user inputs their username. Because the majority of websites tend to use either an email or ID for the identification part, it would be useful to state that Psychology Today's website only accepts usernames. Instead, the current UI just pops up a "User not found" error regardless if the user inputted their email or ID. 

![Heuristic5_V3](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%235_V3.png)
![Heuristic5_V4](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%235_V4.png)

#### #6 – Recognition rather than recall
Severity Rating: 1

Psychology Today does an amazing job of ensuring that they utilize recognition when it comes to finding health care professionals and therapists in your area. Inputting a zipcode or city causes a drop-down list of locations that are affiliated with what the user is typing, minimizing the application of user memory.

![Heuristic6](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%236.png)
![Heuristic_V2](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%236_V2.png)

However, in regards to searching topics, the website could do a better job in providing options as well, especially because they have so many subcategories in their Basics page. Searching "Healthcare" offers no suggestions, despite it being a specific subsection.

![Heuristic_V3](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%236_V3.png)

#### #7 – Flexibility and efficiency of use
Severity Rating: 3

I think the lack of a member profile just for common users make Psychology Today lag behind in comparison to other magazine websites, as it fails to provide users a more efficient experience when browsing. Because there are so many articles, it's very simple to lose track of what a user has read, and without using an account system, the only thing that gives any indication that you have read an article is the literal web browser's cache.

Implementing a user account system would make it more interactive and engaging, all the while containing all of the memory of what the user has accessed, especially for a website that focuses itself on making human life simpler. In addition, it creates a community where people can comment about articles, which in turn increases website traffic.

![Heuristic7](https://github.com/brandonngo72/DH150-class/blob/master/Heuristic%20%237.png)

In the above example, there's no way of knowing you have read an article even after you've read it. Utilizing an account system can allow users to access the articles more efficiently by giving them a "history" list of what they've read and such.

#### #10 – Help and documentation
