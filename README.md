# Psychology Today
Psychology Today is a magazine dedicated to making psychology accessible to the general public. The magazine's website aims to showcase therapy and health care professional directories and psychologist-written articles about the self.  

For the most part, Psychology Today provides a fairly accessible user experience for individuals; it's visually appealing and provides users a very rudimentary clickbait overview. However, the overall website has so much information concentrated on one page that makes it difficult to really pay any mind to any one thing. There's too much copy, and the "Top Posts" header image really doesn't make sense when "Today's Essential Reads" and "Most Popular" are right below it. As a whole, Psychology Today provides a convoluted user experience that ironically makes the mind more busy.
