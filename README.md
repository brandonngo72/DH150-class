# Psychology Today 
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us

Psychology Today is a magazine dedicated to making psychology accessible to the general public. The magazine's website aims to showcase therapy and health care professional directories and psychologist-written articles about the self.  

For the most part, Psychology Today provides a fairly accessible user experience for individuals; it's visually appealing and provides users a very rudimentary clickbait overview. However, the overall website has so much information concentrated on one page that makes it difficult to really pay any mind to any one thing. There's too much copy, and the "Top Posts" header image really doesn't make sense when "Today's Essential Reads" and "Most Popular" are right below it. As a whole, Psychology Today provides a convoluted user experience that ironically makes the mind more busy.

### Heuristic Evaluation of Psychology Today

I will be evaluating each of Jakob Nielsen's 10 Heuristics, qualitatively measuring major usability issues on a severity rating scale of 1-3 (1 being a minor usability issue while 3 being a major usability issue).

#### #1 – Visibility of System Status
Severity Rating: 1

The website showcases a large header photo at the forefront (see above image), entitled "Top Posts" associated with a couple of articles beneath it. However, when hovering over the copy, the user would not be able to know if they were actually clicking on an article or not (it simply blends in with the other copy).

An easy fix would be a simple change of color, or highlighting the text (like above) when you hover over it. This would give the user appropriate feedback in real time that distinguishes the articles' copy from one another.

For the most part, Psychology Today does an overall good job with this heuristic, especially in their "Find a therapist" search bar, which provides users a drop-down list of locations and zip codes that appear as they type.

#### #2 – Match between system and the real world
Severity Rating: 1

The language seen above in the "Basics" section of the website is intended to showcase a list of subcategories that users can access. Even taking into account that most of the categories are psychology-related terminology, some of these subcategories are far too complicated to understand for the general person. Acronyms like 'HEXACO' and words like 'Hebaphilia' aren't necessarily common knowledge.

Still, the urgency of this problem isn't too problematic, which is why I evaluated this heuristic with a severity rating of 1. The methodology of categorization is horrible and will further be discussed in heuristic #7.

#### #3 – User control and freedom
Severity Rating: 

#### #4 – Consistency and standards
Severity Rating: 

#### #5 – Error prevention
Severity Rating: 

#### #6 – Recognition rather than recall
Severity Rating:

#### #7 – Flexibility and efficiency of use
Severity Rating:

#### #8 – Aesthetic and minimalist design
Severity Rating:

#### #9 – Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Severity Rating:

#### #10 – Help and documentation
Severity Rating:
